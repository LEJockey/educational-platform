(McKinsey, 2007).All the evidence from different education systems around the world shows that the most important factor in determining how well children do is the quality of teachers and teaching.“What is the most important school related factor in student learning? The answer is teaching” said Professor Bob Schwartz (Harvard GSE, 2010).There is a consensus that improving teaching quality is one of the most direct and promising strategies for improving education outcomes. Every aspect of school reform depends on highly skilled teachers for its success.'

It is expensive and not worth investing in it.One study shows that if two average eight-year-old students were given different teachers – one of them a high performer, the other a low performer – their performance diverge by more than 50 percentile points within three years.Pivoting your expenditure from less cost-effective to more cost-effective ways of achieving the same objectives.'
